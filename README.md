### Notes on Required Materials
You can get 90 switches at the link above for $49.5 dollars, or 100 for $50. Spend the extra 50 cents.
Some materials above (like the parachord, acrylic, and switches) are up to the user to decide based on personal preference.
I know the switches are PCB monuted on a plate build. I did this becaause I want the remaining PCB mounted switches for future projects and the BULK order price would have been cut if I got plate mounted.

## Phase 1 - Case structure
In terms of the case, all of my research has led me to the famous "Sandwich" case. This case basically has a bunch of layers that are laser cut to make a complete aparatus for your Switches and/or PCB.

### Sandwich Case details
The case consists of the following layers:
* Top Layer: The top layer is the border that covers the switch layer. This can be any height that is below the keycap height.
* Switch Layer: The switch layer has to be 1.5mm to 1.0mm in order for the cherry switches to properly clip onto the layer.
* Spacers: Currently, the research I have conducted shows that 15.0mm of spacers seems to be a comfortable balance for room for wires and the PCB. Keep in mind these layers will be hosting the cable connection for the keyboard.
* Bottom Layer: This laayer can be as thick as you want.

### Materials
* Acrylic: Popular, cost effective, could flex but thicker layers and proper engineering can reduce this.
* Wood: Why...just dont
* Metal: if you have the money, then sure this is a great material!
