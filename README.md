### Notes on Required Materials
You can get 90 switches at the link above for $49.5 dollars, or 100 for $50. Spend the extra 50 cents.
Some materials above (like the parachord, acrylic, and switches) are up to the user to decide based on personal preference.
I know the switches are PCB monuted on a plate build. I did this becaause I want the remaining PCB mounted switches for future projects and the BULK order price would have been cut if I got plate mounted.

## Phase 1 - Case structure
